### About the Project

Ever wanted to know what everyone’s been tweeting about? Well, thanks to Twitter’s use of the hasthag system, that’s already possible. But how about the most popular places everyone’s been tweeting from? Or how about a simplified way to see how all those twitter users are feeling? Thanks to some in-depth exploratory analyses from Dr. Jeff Goldsmith’s* (Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health) Team AwesomeTM,  and courtesy of Followthehashtag’s publicly available twitter APIs, even this is possible. 

In a rapidly changing and increasingly tech-based world, people now have the power to essentially react to global events happening thousands of miles away in real time. Social media as whole, but twitter especially, are some of the biggest domains for capturing these reactions. Our team’s motivation for this analysis comes from a desire to aggregate these reactions in as compact and sensible format as possible. 

The dataset we used from Followthehashtag is a comprehensive but incomplete list of 200,000 tweets from users across the United States (and outside the U.S., but we focused on domestic tweets) from April 14, 2016 to April 16, 2016, which comes as an easy-to-access csv file within a zipped folder. For each tweet, user information such as name, location (latitude/longitude), number of followers, and the entire content of the tweet itself is given. We used the Syuzhet package from GitHub (thank you Matthew Jockers!) to extract sentiments from tweet content. Our primary analyses consisted of mapping these tweets (using tweet location) as observable sentiments across the United States, which gives a nice aggregate picture of how the U.S. twitterverse was feeling during the dates mentioned above. 

About the Sentiment function:
Matthew Jockers’s sentiment function is essentially a dictionary that assigns different words to different sentiments. The general sentiments he uses in this function (and subsequently the ones we use in our analyses) are trust, joy, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, anticipation, and surprise. While some of these sentiments may not seem intuitive to use, altogether they form a relatively broad spectrum of moods and emotions which make for interesting analyses.
